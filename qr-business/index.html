  <h1>QR Code for Business</h1>
  <p>
    QR codes have completely transformed the way businesses interact with customers in the digital era. 
    From small local shops to large multinational brands, QR codes are now a powerful bridge between 
    offline marketing and online engagement. They provide instant access to websites, payment systems, 
    digital menus, product information, and promotional campaigns with just one simple scan.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the biggest advantages of QR codes for businesses is convenience. Customers no longer need 
    to type long URLs or search manually. A quick scan using a smartphone camera can instantly redirect 
    them to a landing page, offer page, contact form, or even a WhatsApp chat. This reduces friction 
    and increases conversion rates significantly.
